  "usage": "\n#### 1. Get a RevenueCat API key\n\nLog in to the [RevenueCat dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com) and obtain a free API key for your application.\n\n#### 2. Initialize the SDK\n\nYou should only configure _Purchases_ once (usually on app launch) as soon as your app has a unique user id for your user. This can be when a user logs in if you have accounts or on launch if you can generate a random user identifier.\n\n```typescript\n import { Platform } from \"@ionic/angular\";\n import { Purchases } from \"@ionic-native/purchases/ngx\";\n\n constructor(public platform: Platform, private purchases: Purchases) {\n     platform.ready().then(() => {\n         this.purchases.setDebugLogsEnabled(true); // Enable to get debug logs\n         this.purchases.setup(\"my_api_key\", \"my_app_user_id\");\n     }\n }\n```\n\n#### 3. Quickstart\nPlease follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the SDK\n\n### Requirements\nRequires XCode 11.0+ and minimum target iOS 9.0+\nThis plugin has been tested with cordova-plugin-purchases@\n",
