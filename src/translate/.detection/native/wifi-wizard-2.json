  "description": "\nWifiWizard2 enables Wifi management for both Android and iOS applications within Cordova/Phonegap projects.\n\nThis project is a fork of the WifiWizard plugin with fixes and updates, as well as patches taken from the Cordova Network Manager plugin.\n",
  "usage": "\n```typescript\nimport { WifiWizard2 } from '@ionic-native/wifi-wizard-2/ngx';\n\n\nconstructor(private wifiWizard2: WifiWizard2) { }\n\n\n# Global Functions\n These are functions that can be used by both Android and iOS applications\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedSSID()\n ```\n - Returns connected network SSID (only if connected) in success callback, otherwise fail callback will be called (if not connected or unable to retrieve)\n - This does **NOT** return the BSSID if unable to obtain SSID (like original WifiWizard did)\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedBSSID()\n ```\n - Same as above, except BSSID (mac) is returned\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.timeout(delay)\n ```\n - `delay` should be time in milliseconds to delay\n - Helper async timeout delay, `delay` is optional, default is 2000ms = 2 seconds\n - This method always returns a resolved promise after the delay, it will never reject or throw an error\n\n **Example inside async function**\n ```typescript\n async function example(){\n    await this.wifiWizard2.timeout(4000);\n    // do something after 4 seconds\n}\n ```\n\n **Example inside standard non-async function**\n ```typescript\n function example(){\n    this.wifiWizard2.timeout(4000).then( function(){\n        // do something after waiting 4 seconds\n    }):\n}\n ```\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `TIMEOUT_WAITING_FOR_SCAN` on timeout waiting for scan 10 seconds +\n - `SCAN_FAILED` if unable to start scan\n\n # iOS Functions\n For functionality, you need to note the following:\n - Connect/Disconnect only works for iOS11+\n - Can't run in the simulator so you need to attach an actual device when building with xCode\n - Will ensure 'HotspotConfiguration' and 'NetworkExtensions' capabilities are added to your xCode project\n - To connect to open network omit `ssidPassword` or call with `false`\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.iOSConnectNetwork(ssid, ssidPassword)\n ```\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.iOSDisconnectNetwork(ssid)\n ```\n\n # Android Functions\n - **WifiWizard2** *will automagically try to enable WiFi if it's disabled when calling any android related methods that require WiFi to be enabled*\n\n ## Connect vs Enable\n When writing Android Java code, there is no `connect` methods, you basically either `enable` or `disable` a network. In the original versions of WifiWizard the `connect` method would basically just call `enable` in Android.\n I have changed the way this works in WifiWizard2 version 3.0.0+, converting it to a helper method to eliminate having to call `formatWifiConfig` then `add` and then `enable` ... the `connect` method will now automatically call `formatWifiConfig`, then call `add` to either add or update the network configuration, and then call `enable`.\n If the connect method is unable to update existing network configuration (added by user or other apps), but there is a valid network ID, it will still attempt to enable that network ID.\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.connect(ssid, bindAll, password, algorithm, isHiddenSSID)\n ```\n - `ssid` should be the SSID to connect to *required*\n - `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection (default is `false`) *optional*\n - See `WifiWizard2.enable` for more details regarding `bindAll` feature\n - `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network\n - Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms\n - For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm\n - Set `isHiddenSSID` to `true` if the network you're connecting to is hidden\n - These arguments are the same as for `formatWifiConfig`\n - This method essentially calls `formatWifiConfig` then `add` then `enable`\n - If unable to update network configuration (was added by user or other app), but a valid network ID exists, this method will still attempt to enable the network\n - Promise will not be returned until method has verified that connection to WiFi was in completed state (waits up to 60 seconds)\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n\n - `CONNECT_FAILED_TIMEOUT` unable to verify connection, timed out after 60 seconds\n - `INVALID_NETWORK_ID_TO_CONNECT` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config\n - `INTERPUT_EXCEPT_WHILE_CONNECTING` Interupt exception while waiting for connection\n\n\n\n ## Disconnect vs Disable\n Same as above for Connect vs Enable, except in this situation, `disconnect` will first disable the network, and then attempt to remove it (if SSID is passed)\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.disconnect(ssid)\n ```\n - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)\n - `ssid` is **OPTIONAL** .. if not passed, will disconnect current WiFi (almost all Android versions now will just automatically reconnect to last wifi after disconnecting)\n - If `ssid` is provided, this method will first attempt to `disable` and then `remove` the network\n - If you do not want to remove network configuration, use `disable` instead\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `DISCONNECT_NET_REMOVE_ERROR` Android returned error when removing wifi configuration\n - `DISCONNECT_NET_DISABLE_ERROR` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config\n - `DISCONNECT_NET_ID_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID to disconnect/remove (from passed SSID)\n - `ERROR_DISCONNECT` - Android error disconnecting wifi (only when SSID is not passed)\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig(ssid, password, algorithm, isHiddenSSID)\n ```\n - `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network\n - Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms\n - For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm\n - Set `isHiddenSSID` to `true` if the network you're connecting to is hidden\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.formatWPAConfig(ssid, password, isHiddenSSID)\n ```\n - This is just a helper method that calls `WifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig( ssid, password, 'WPA', isHiddenSSID );`\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.add(wifi)\n ```\n - `wifi` must be an object formatted by `formatWifiConfig`, this **must** be done before calling `enable`\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `AUTH_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED` - Invalid auth type specified\n - `ERROR_ADDING_NETWORK` - Android returned `-1` specifying error adding network\n - `ERROR_UPDATING_NETWORK` - Same as above, except an existing network ID was found, and unable to update it\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.remove(ssid)\n ```\n - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)\n - Please note, most newer versions of Android will only allow wifi to be removed if created by your application\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `UNABLE_TO_REMOVE` Android returned failure in removing network\n - `REMOVE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID\n\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.listNetworks()\n ```\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.scan([options])\n ```\n - Same as calling `startScan` and then `getScanResults`, except this method will only resolve the promise after the scan completes and returns the results.\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.startScan()\n ```\n - It is recommended to just use the `scan` method instead of `startScan`\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `STARTSCAN_FAILED` Android returned failure in starting scan\n\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getScanResults([options])\n ```\n - `getScanResults` should only be called after calling `startScan` (it is recommended to use `scan` instead as this starts the scan, then returns the results)\n - `[options]` is optional, if you do not want to specify, just pass `success` callback as first parameter, and `fail` callback as second parameter\n - Retrieves a list of the available networks as an array of objects and passes them to the function listHandler. The format of the array is:\n ```typescript\n networks = [\n {   \"level\": signal_level, // raw RSSI value\n        \"SSID\": ssid, // SSID as string, with escaped double quotes: \"\\\"ssid name\\\"\"\n        \"BSSID\": bssid // MAC address of WiFi router as string\n        \"frequency\": frequency of the access point channel in MHz\n        \"capabilities\": capabilities // Describes the authentication, key management, and encryption schemes supported by the access point.\n        \"timestamp\": timestamp // timestamp of when the scan was completed\n        \"channelWidth\":\n        \"centerFreq0\":\n        \"centerFreq1\":\n    }\n ]\n ```\n - `channelWidth` `centerFreq0` and `centerFreq1` are only supported on API > 23 (Marshmallow), any older API will return null for these values\n\n An options object may be passed. Currently, the only supported option is `numLevels`, and it has the following behavior:\n\n - if `(n == true || n < 2)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will return data as before, split in 5 levels;\n - if `(n > 1)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will calculate the signal level, split in n levels;\n - if `(n == false)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will use the raw signal level;\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.isWifiEnabled()\n ```\n - Returns boolean value of whether Wifi is enabled or not\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.setWifiEnabled(enabled)\n ```\n - Pass `true` for `enabled` parameter to set Wifi enabled\n - You do not need to call this function to set WiFi enabled to call other methods that require wifi enabled.  This plugin will automagically enable WiFi if a method is called that requires WiFi to be enabled.\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `ERROR_SETWIFIENABLED` wifi state does not match call (enable or disable)\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedNetworkID()\n ```\n - Returns currently connected network ID in success callback (only if connected), otherwise fail callback will be called\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `GET_CONNECTED_NET_ID_ERROR` Unable to determine currently connected network ID (may not be connected)\n\n ## New to 3.1.1+\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.resetBindAll()\n ```\n - Disable bindAll to WiFi network without disconnecting from WiFi\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.setBindAll()\n ```\n - Enable bindAll to WiFi network without disconnecting from WiFi\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.canConnectToInternet()\n ```\n\n - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to connect to https://www.google.com via HTTP connection (since ping is unreliable)\n - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions\n - If you called `connect` or `enable` and passed `true` for `bindAll`, your application will force the ping through wifi connection.\n - If you did not pass `true` (or passed `false`) for `bindAll`, and the wifi does not have internet connection, Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will use cell connection to ping (due to Android using cell connection when wifi does not have internet) [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)\n\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.canConnectToRouter()\n ```\n - As `canPingWifiRouter` is notoriously unreliable, this method uses HTTP connection to test if able to connect to router (as most routers should have web server running on port 80)\n - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions\n - This is useful for testing to make sure that your Android app is able to connect to the private network after connecting to WiFi\n - This was added for testing the `bindAll` feature to support issues with Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) not routing calls through WiFi if WiFi does not have internet connection [See Android Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)\n - Attempts to connect router IP HTTP server on port 80 (example: `http://192.168.0.1/` where `192.168.0.1` is the automatically detected IP address)\n\n ## New to 3.0.0+\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.isConnectedToInternet()\n ```\n\n - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping 8.8.8.8\n - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions\n - If you called `connect` or `enable` and passed `true` for `bindAll`, your application will force the ping through wifi connection.\n - If you did not pass `true` (or passed `false`) for `bindAll`, and the wifi does not have internet connection, Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will use cell connection to ping (due to Android using cell connection when wifi does not have internet) [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.canPingWifiRouter()\n ```\n\n - Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping the connected WiFi router IP (obtained from DHCP info)\n - Version 3.1.1+ uses HTTP connection to test if able to connect to router (as ping previous did not work)\n - Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions\n - This is useful for testing to make sure that your Android app is able to connect to the private network after connecting to WiFi\n - This was added for testing the `bindAll` feature to support issues with Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) not routing calls through WiFi if WiFi does not have internet connection [See Android Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.enableWifi()\n ```\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.disableWifi()\n ```\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getWifiIP()\n ```\n - Returns IPv4 address of currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if IP not found or wifi not connected\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getWifiRouterIP()\n ```\n - Returns IPv4 WiFi router IP from currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if unable to determine, or wifi not connected\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getWifiIPInfo()\n ```\n - Returns a JSON object with IPv4 address and subnet `{\"ip\": \"192.168.1.2\", \"subnet\": \"255.255.255.0\" }` or rejected promise if not found or not connected\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.reconnect()\n ```\n - Reconnect to the currently active access point, **if we are currently disconnected.**\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `ERROR_RECONNECT` Android returned error when reconnecting\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.reassociate()\n ```\n - Reconnect to the currently active access point, **even if we are already connected.**\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `ERROR_REASSOCIATE` Android returned error when reassociating\n\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.getSSIDNetworkID(ssid)\n ```\n - Get Android Network ID from passed SSID\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.disable(ssid)\n ```\n - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)\n - Disable the passed SSID network\n - Please note that most newer versions of Android will only allow you to disable networks created by your application\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `UNABLE_TO_DISABLE` Android returned failure in disabling network\n - `DISABLE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID to disable\n\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.requestPermission()\n ```\n - Request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permssion\n - This Android permission is required to run `scan`, `startStart` and `getScanResults`\n - You can request permission by running this function manually, or WifiWizard2 will automagically request permission when one of the functions above is called\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n - `PERMISSION_DENIED` user denied permission on device\n\n\n ```typescript\n this.wifiWizard2.enable(ssid, bindAll, waitForConnection)\n ```\n - `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)\n - `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection\n - Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will not route connections to the WiFi device if it does not have internet connection.  Passing `true` to `bindAll` will force Android to route connections from your Android app through Wifi, regardless of internet connection.\n - If you are having problems connecting to a local IP through WiFi because it does not have internet, try enabling `bindAll` and this should fix the problem.\n - During my testing, some versions of Android (5.0 - 7.1.2) would still route connections through WiFi without internet, but it was random that some versions would and would not work.\n - Testing Android Oreo+ (8.0.0+) if wifi does not have internet, 100% of the time it would NOT route connections through WiFi, so you *must* enable this for Oreo or newer to route connections from your application through wifi without internet.\n - When `bindAll` is enabled, *ALL* connections from your app will be routed through WiFi, until you call `disconnect` or `disable`\n - See the Google Android Blog for [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)\n - This feature *ONLY* works for Android Lollipop+ (API 21+), if device is running API older than 21, `bindall` will be ignored (as API older than 21 does this by default)\n - Enable the passed SSID network\n - You **MUST** call `WifiWizard2.add(wifi)` before calling `enable` as the wifi configuration must exist before you can enable it (or previously used `connect` without calling `disconnect`)\n - This method does NOT wait or verify connection to wifi network, pass `true` to `waitForConnection` to only return promise once connection is verified in COMPLETED state to specific `ssid`\n\n **Thrown Errors**\n\n `UNABLE_TO_ENABLE` - Android returned `-1` signifying failure enabling\n\n # Installation\n\n ## Master\n\n Run ```cordova plugin add https://github.com/tripflex/wifiwizard2```\n\n To install from the master branch (latest on GitHub)\n\n To install a specific branch (add `#tag` replacing `tag` with tag from this repo, example:\n ```cordova plugin add https://github.com/tripflex/wifiwizard2#v3.1.1```\n\n Find available tags here:\n https://github.com/tripflex/WifiWizard2/tags\n\n\n If you are wanting to have the latest and greatest stable version, then run the 'Releases' command below.\n\n ## Releases\n Run ```cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-wifiwizard2```\n\n ## Meteor\n To install and use this plugin in a Meteor project, you have to specify the exact version from NPM repository:\n [https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-wifiwizard2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-wifiwizard2)\n\n As of April 4th 2019, the latest version is 3.1.1:\n\n ```meteor add cordova:cordova-plugin-wifiwizard2@3.1.1```\n\n # Errors/Rejections\n Methods now return formatted string errors as detailed below, instead of returning generic error messages.
