Columns are cellular components of the [grid](../grid) system and go inside of a [row](../row).
They will expand to fill their row. All content within a grid should go inside of a column.

See [Grid Layout](/docs/layout/grid) for more information.


## Column Alignment

By default, columns will stretch to fill the entire height of the row. Columns are [flex items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Item), so there are several [CSS classes](/docs/layout/css-utilities#flex-item-properties) that can be applied to a column to customize this behavior.
