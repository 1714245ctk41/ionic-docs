The essential purpose of badge numbers is to enable an application to inform its users that it has something for them — for example, unread messages — when the application isn’t running in the foreground.

Cordovaプラグインが必要: cordova-plugin-badge. 詳しくは [Badge plugin docs](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-badge) をご覧ください。
