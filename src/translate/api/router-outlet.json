For vanilla or Stencil JavaScript projects, use [`ion-router`](../router) and [`ion-route`](../route).\n\nAlthough router outlet has methods for navigating around, it's recommended to use the navigation methods in your framework's router.\n\n\n## Life Cycle Hooks\n\nRoutes rendered in a Router Outlet have access to specific Ionic events that are wired up to animations\n\n\n| Event Name         | Trigger                                                            |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `ionViewWillEnter` | Fired when the component routing to is about to animate into view. |\n| `ionViewDidEnter`  | Fired when the component routing to has finished animating.        |\n| `ionViewWillLeave` | Fired when the component routing from is about to animate.         |\n| `ionViewDidLeave`  | Fired when the component routing to has finished animating.        |\n\n\nThese event tie into Ionic's animation system and can be used to coordinate parts of your app when a Components is done with its animation. These events are not a replacement for your framework's own event system, but an addition.\n\nFor handling Router Guards, the older `ionViewCanEnter` and `ionViewCanLeave` have been replaced with their framework specific equivalent. For Angular, there are [Router Guards](https://angular.io/guide/router#milestone-5-route-guards).\n\n",
